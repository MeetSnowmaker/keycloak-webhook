# Changelog

## [next]

### Fixed

- The build was broken on `main`: the HTTP module did not compile (`sessionId` from #67 was missing in the OpenAPI
  schema), and the release jars could not be built with Gradle 9. Both fixes come from #90
- Every Keycloak session opened and closed its own AMQP connection, HTTP client and Syslog sender. Each provider now
  keeps one for the lifetime of the server and closes it on shutdown
- An unreachable RabbitMQ broker made listener creation throw into Keycloak; the event is now logged and dropped
- AMQP publisher confirms from concurrent requests could interfere with each other, and confirm mode was lost after a
  reconnect
- A connection dropped by the broker could come back through automatic recovery as a second, leaked connection
- `WEBHOOK_AMQP_VHOST` is optional as documented, defaulting to `/` (leaving it out used to fail)

### Changed

- Missing or malformed settings are reported in one error that names every problem key, instead of a
  `NullPointerException`

### Added

- AMQP opt-ins, each off unless set: `WEBHOOK_AMQP_ADDRESSES` for clusters, `WEBHOOK_AMQP_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`,
  certificate verification with `WEBHOOK_AMQP_SSL_TRUSTSTORE` (plus `_PASSWORD`, `_TYPE`), persistent messages
  (`WEBHOOK_AMQP_PERSISTENT`), per-message ids (`WEBHOOK_AMQP_MESSAGE_ID`) and declaring the exchange
  (`WEBHOOK_AMQP_DECLARE_EXCHANGE`)
- `WEBHOOK_AMQP_PUBLISH_MODE=async`: publishing on a background thread with an in-memory buffer
  (`WEBHOOK_AMQP_BUFFER_CAPACITY`), so logins never wait for RabbitMQ. With publisher confirms, delivery is at least
  once: unconfirmed messages are sent again after a reconnect or a confirm timeout, refused ones are retried 5 times,
  and at most `WEBHOOK_AMQP_INFLIGHT_CAPACITY` wait for a confirm at once
- `WEBHOOK_AMQP_MANDATORY`: publishes with the mandatory flag and logs every message the broker returns because no
  queue is bound to receive it (confirms alone report those as delivered)
- A warning when TLS is on without a truststore, since the broker's certificate is then not verified
- Behaviour tests for every provider, including RabbitMQ through Testcontainers, run by CI on every push
- README: publisher confirm settings, defaults, routing keys, and how delivery behaves when a destination is down
